# Okteta data structure definitions

Some assorted Okteta data structures written in JavaScript.

- Bcachefs on-disk filesystem structures (for an old version from circa
  2022-2023, now superseded but still has some documentary value)
- GPT, the GUID Partition Table on-disk structures (both legacy 512-byte LBA
  size and 4096 (4K) LBA size). These are the two most common sizes.
